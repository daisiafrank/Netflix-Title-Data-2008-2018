This could be due to Netflix's focus on producing and acquiring episodic content.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1. Content Diversity:\n\n#### a) What genres are most popular on Netflix?\n\nTo determine this, we'll look at the `listed_in` column and count the occurrences of each genre.\n\n#### Most Popular Genres on Netflix:\n1. International Movies: 1927\n2. Dramas: 1623\n3. Comedies: 1113\n4. International TV Shows: 1001\n5. Documentaries: 668\n6. TV Dramas: 599\n7. Action & Adventure: 597\n8. Independent Movies: 552\n9. TV Comedies: 436\n10. Thrillers: 392\n\n### 2. Content Production:\n\n#### a) What is the growth rate of new content added to Netflix annually?\n\nFor this, we will look at the `date_added` column, extract the year, and count the number of titles added each year.\n\n#### Growth Rate of New Content Added Annually:\n- 2009: No data from the previous year for comparison.\n- 2010: -50.0% (Decrease)\n- 2011: 1200.0% (Increase)\n- 2012: -46.15% (Decrease)\n- 2013: 71.43% (Increase)\n- 2014: 108.33% (Increase)\n- 2015: 260.0% (Increase)\n- 2016: 406.67% (Increase)\n- 2017: 185.09% (Increase)\n- 2018: 37.08% (Increase)\n- 2019: 31.82% (Increase)\n- 2020: -92.17% (Significant Decrease)\n\nNote: The significant decrease in 2020 might be due to incomplete data for that year or other external factors (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic affecting production).\n\n#### b) How much of the content is Netflix original vs. licensed?\n\nThe dataset doesn't directly indicate whether a title is a Netflix original or licensed. However, one potential (though not entirely accurate) approach is to look for titles where the `date_added` is close to the `release_year`. If the difference is small, it could be an indicator that the title is a Netflix original. Let's calculate the proportion of potential originals using this approach, with a difference of 1 year as the threshold.\n\n#### Proportion of Potential Netflix Originals:\nApproximately 55.04% of the content might be Netflix originals, based on the criterion of a 1-year difference between the date added and the release year.\n\n### 3. Global Reach:\n\n#### a) In how many different countries is Netflix producing content?\n\nTo determine this, we'll look at the `country` column and count the unique countries mentioned.\n\n#### Number of Different Countries Producing Content for Netflix:\nNetflix has content produced in 113 different countries.\n\n\n### 4. Content Lifespan:\n\n#### How long does content stay on Netflix? \n\nThe dataset doesn't provide the removal date for titles, so we can't directly determine the lifespan of content on Netflix. \n\n### 5. Viewer Preferences:\n\nThe dataset doesn't include viewer ratings, so we can't answer questions related to viewer preferences directly.\n\nLet's continue with the remaining questions.\n\n### 6. Talent Collaborations:\n\n#### a) With which directors does Netflix collaborate most frequently?\n\nTo determine this, we'll look at the `director` column and count the occurrences of each director.\n\n#### Most Frequent Directors on Netflix:\n1. Jan Suter: 21 titles\n2. Ra√∫l Campos: 19 titles\n3. Jay Karas: 14 titles\n4. Marcus Raboy: 14 titles\n5. Jay Chapman: 12 titles\n6. Steven Spielberg: 9 titles\n7. Martin Scorsese: 9 titles\n8. Lance Bangs: 8 titles\n9. Johnnie To: 8 titles\n10. Umesh Mehra: 8 titles\n\n### 7. Seasonal Trends:\n\n#### a) Are there specific months or seasons when Netflix releases more content?\n\nTo determine this, we'll extract the month from the `date_added` column and count the number of titles added each month.\n\n#### Monthly Content Additions on Netflix:\n1. January: 610 titles\n2. February: 378 titles\n3. March: 551 titles\n4. April: 447 titles\n5. May: 428 titles\n6. June: 393 titles\n7. July: 474 titles\n8. August: 509 titles\n9. September: 479 titles\n10. October: 646 titles\n11. November: 612 titles\n12. December: 696 titles\n\nFrom the data, we observe that Netflix adds the most content during the months of October, November, and December, with December being the month with the highest number of additions.\n\n### 8. Content Format:\n\n#### a) What is the ratio of TV shows to movies?\n\nTo determine this, we'll look at the `type` column and count the occurrences of each content type.\n\n#### Content Types on Netflix:\n- Movies: 4,265 titles\n- TV Shows: 1,969 titles\n\n#### Ratio of TV Shows to Movies:\nApproximately 0.462, meaning for every movie on Netflix, there are about 0.462 TV shows, or approximately 1 TV show for every 2 movies.\n\n### 9. Content Age:\n\n#### a) What is the distribution of content release years?\n\nTo understand the age distribution of the content on Netflix, we'll count the number of titles released in each year.\n\n#### Distribution of Content Release Years (Last 10 Years):\n- 2011: 136 titles\n- 2012: 183 titles\n- 2013: 237 titles\n- 2014: 288 titles\n- 2015: 517 titles\n- 2016: 830 titles\n- 2017: 959 titles\n- 2018: 1063 titles\n- 2019: 843 titles\n- 2020: 25 titles\n\nFrom this distribution, we can observe:\n- There's been a steady increase in the number of titles released each year from 2011 to 2018.\n- In 2019, there's a slight decrease compared to 2018.\n- The count for 2020 is significantly lower, possibly due to incomplete data or external factors, like the COVID-19 pandemic impacting production.\n\n#### b) Is Netflix focusing more on newer content, or is there a mix of classics and new releases?\n\nBy observing the distribution above, it's evident that Netflix has a substantial amount of newer content from recent years. However, to further analyze the mix of classics vs. new releases, we can look at the proportion of content that was released in the last decade compared to content from previous decades.\n\n#### Proportion of Content Based on Release Year:\n- Content from the last decade (2010-2020): Approximately 83.89%\n- Content from previous decades (before 2010): Approximately 16.11%\n\nThis indicates that Netflix has a significant focus on newer content, with the majority of its titles being released in the last decade. However, there is still a mix with around 16% of titles being classics or content from before 2010.\n\n### 10.
